Project Overview
This Android project is developed following the MVVM clean architecture using Kotlin and XML with Jetpack components. It consists of two modules:

App Module: Contains the core application two screens.
Management Module: Includes additional functionalities related to DI, database, DAO, networking, models, and domain logic.
App Module
The app module serves as the primary module for the application, responsible for core functionalities and user interaction. It provides the following screens:

Listing Screen: Displays a list of items fetched from the backend or local database.
Details Screen: Shows detailed information about a selected item from the listing screen.
Management Module
The management module is designed to handle supporting functionalities and backend interactions:

Dependency Injection (DI): Utilizes Dagger Hilt for managing dependencies across modules.
Database and DAO: Implements Room Persistence Library for local database operations.
Networking and API Requests: Uses Retrofit for making network requests and handling API responses.
Models and Domain Logic: Defines data models and business logic related to the application domain.
Features
Modular Architecture: The project is structured using a modular approach with separate core (app) and supporting (management) modules.
MVVM Design Pattern: Follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern to separate UI logic from business logic.
Jetpack Components: Utilizes Jetpack components like ViewModel, LiveData, Navigation, and Data Binding.
Dependency Injection: Dagger Hilt is used for managing dependencies and facilitating modular development.
